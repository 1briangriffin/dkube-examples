# Insurance Cost Prediction Example Monitoring

 This section explains how to create, start, and test the monitoring capability of DKube using the insurance prediction example.  There are 2 ways to create the monitor:
 - Using a JupyterLab notebook
 - Using the DKube UI

## Create Monitor Automatically Using JupyterLab
 This approach will automatically create and start the Monitor through an .ipynb file.  This allows an easy way to get the Monitor ready, and allows you to then start to use the Monitor without needing to understand the steps involved.  The instructions for this are contained in the file [Create Monitor Automatically](monitoring-nb.md)
 
## Create Monitor Manually Through DKube UI
 This approach explains how to create a Monitor manually using the DKube UI.  This offers a more complete understanding of how the Monitor is created, and how each section fits into the Monitor workflow.  The instructions for this are contained in the file [Create Monitor Manually](monitoring-ui.md)
