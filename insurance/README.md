# INSURANCE EXAMPLE

- This example supports 3 dataset sources i.e. **Local, AWS S3 and SQL**. 
- By default this example uses local data source.
  - Local data source is created in DKube storage space
- The notebooks in this example can be run inside or outside Dkube.

## Example Flow
- Create DKube resources. This includes Dataset and Model repo resources.
- (Optional) Train a model for Insurance example using SkLearn and deploy the model for inference.
- Create a Modelmonitor. 
  - There is no requirement to deploy a model for this example
  - Generate data for analysis by Modelmonitor
    - Predict data: Inference inputs/outputs
    - Label data:  Dataset with Groundtruth values for the inferences made above
  ** In production, the predict data would be logged by the deployed model and Label data would be generated by experts in the domain manually.
- (Optional) Retrain the model and update Modelmonitor
- Cleanup resources after the example is complete


## Prerequisites
- For Aws_S3 **(S3 bucket is required)**
  - Create an AWS S3 bucket with the name mm-workflow. 
  - You need access and secret keys to access the bucket.
- For SQL **(SQL database is required)**. 
  - You need the following to access the SQL Database
    - username
    - password
    - hostaddress (server address)
    - portnumber
    - databasename


## Section 1: Create Dkube Resources
#### Note: Skip the Dataset (SQL) step if your data is in aws-s3 or in local.It will be automatically created by resources.ipynb notebook.

### Dataset (SQL)
1. Add dataset **insurance-data-sql**
2. Versioning: None
3. Source : SQL
4. Provider : MYSQL
5. Select password and fill the details
- Username, Password, HostAddress, PortNumber, Database Name

### Launch IDE (Inside Dkube)

1. Add Code. Create Code Repo in Dkube with the following information
  - Name: insurance
  - Source: Git
  - URL: https://github.com/oneconvergence/dkube-examples.git
  - Branch : monitoring
2. Create an IDE (JupyterLab)
   - Use sklearn framework
   - **If your data is in local**, move to step 3 directly.
   - **If your data is in aws_s3:**
     - Add the following environment variables with your secret values in configuration tab 
       - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - **If your data is in SQL:**
     - Add the following environment variables with your secret values in configuration tab
       - USERNAME, PASSWORD, HOSTADDRESS, DATABASENAME    
3. Click Submit.
4. From workspace/insurance/insurance open resources.ipynb and fill the following details in the first cell. 
     - **MODELMONITOR_NAME** = {your model monitor name}
     - **DATASET_SOURCE** = { one of your choice in ['local' or 'aws_s3' or 'sql'] }
     - **INPUT_TRAIN_TYPE** = {'training'}
     - The following will be derived from the environment automatically. Otherwise, please fill in 
       - **TOKEN** = {your dkube authentication token}
       - **URL** = {your dkube url}
       - **DKUBEUSERNAME** = {your dkube username}
       - **OUTSIDE_DKUBE** = True
       - If the data source is **aws_s3**, fill the below details also:
         - **ACCESS_KEY** = {your s3 access key}
         - **SECRET_KEY** = {your s3 secret key}
       - If the data source is **sql**, fill the below details also:
         - **HOSTNAME** = {sql server hostname}
         - **DATABASENAME** = {sql database name} 
         - **DBUSERNAME** = {your username}
         - **PASSWORD** = {your password}
5. Run all the cells. This will create all the dkube resources required for this example automatically. It will also create a details.txt file which contains the model monitor information.

### Launch IDE (Outside Dkube)

1. Download [resources.ipynb](https://github.com/oneconvergence/dkube-examples/tree/monitoring/insurance/resources.ipynb)
2. Open the notebook and fill the details in the first cell.
   - **MODELMONITOR_NAME** = {your model monitor name}
   - **DATASET_SOURCE** = { one of your choice in ['local' or 'aws_s3' or 'sql'] }
   - **INPUT_TRAIN_TYPE** = {'training'}
   - **TOKEN** = {your dkube authentication token}
   - **URL** = {your dkube url}
   - **DKUBEUSERNAME** = {your dkube username}
   - **OUTSIDE_DKUBE** = True
   - If the data source is **aws_s3**, fill the below details also:
     - **ACCESS_KEY** = {your s3 access key}
     - **SECRET_KEY** = {your s3 secret key}
   - If the data source is **sql**, fill the below details also:
     - **HOSTNAME** = {sql server hostname}
     - **DATABASENAME** = {sql database name} 
     - **DBUSERNAME** = {your username}
     - **PASSWORD** = {your password}
3. Run all the cells.

## Section 2: (Optional) Insurance Model Training
** Note: This uses DKube Runs, Kubeflow Pipelines and KfServing. If your DKube configuration doesn't support this, please skip this step and goto Modelmonitoring Section **
1. From **workspace/insurance/insurance** open **train.ipynb** to build the pipeline.
2. The pipeline includes preprocessing, training and serving stages. Run all cells
     - **preprocessing**: the preprocessing stage generates the dataset (either training-data or retraining-data) depending on user choice.
     - **training**: the training stage takes the generated dataset as input, train a sgd model and outputs the model.
     - **serving**: The serving stage takes the generated model and serve it with a predict endpoint for inference. 
3. Verify that the pipeline has created the following resources
     - Datasets: 'insurance-training-data' with version v2.
     - Model: 'insurance-model' with version v2

### Inference
1. Go to webapp directory, and build a docker image with given **Dockerfile** or pull **ocdr/streamlit-webapp:insurance**.
2. Run command  
     - docker run -p 8501:8501 ocdr/streamlit-webapp:insurance 
3. Open http://localhost:8501/ in your browser,
     - Fill serving URL, auth token and other details and click predict.


## Section 3: Modelmonitoring
DKube provides Python SDK for creating a modelmonitor programmatically. You could also choose to create a modelmonitor from the DKube UI. Follow one of the following workflows as per your need.

- **Create Modelmonitor using SDK**
  - Follow [README.sdk.md](https://github.com/oneconvergence/dkube-examples/blob/monitoring/insurance/README.sdk.md) for the next steps.
- **Create Modelmonitor using UI**
  - Follow [README.ui.md](https://github.com/oneconvergence/dkube-examples/blob/monitoring/insurance/README.ui.md) for the next steps.
